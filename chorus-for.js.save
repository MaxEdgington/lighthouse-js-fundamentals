Looping and Repetition

Looping is a crucial feature of programming languages that we'll need to understand before we can solve most programming problems. In this exercise, we're going to practice two common types of loops: the for loop and the while loop.

While Loops
Instruction
Create a new file to tinker with the while loop examples.

Create a new file in your lighthouse-js-fundamentals directory on Vagrant called chorus-while.js. Write out the following code into the file. Every time there is a code example in this exercise, write it out in a JavaScript file and run it. Then try changing the code a bit—update values, reorder statements, etc.—to see how the output changes.

We've been working with a pop idol on a new song, and to make sure it's a bonafide ear worm, the label wants us to repeat the chorus ten times at the end of the song. Wanting to practice some JavaScript, we decide to write a while loop to print out the chorus ten times.

const chorus = "Let's dance!";
let repeat = 0;
while (repeat < 10) {
  console.log(chorus);
  repeat++;
}
console.log("Until the sun comes up!");
We should see "Let's dance!" printed 10 times, followed by "Until the sun comes up!".

How does this work? The while statement, similar to an if, takes a condition, and as long as this condition evaluates to true, the code inside the block will be executed again and again. To make sure we don't execute this code forever, we've declared a repeat variable that starts at 0 and increments by 1 (repeat++ is shorthand for repeat = repeat + 1) at every repetition of the block. The following is a representation of what our condition looks like at every step.

(0 < 10) // repeat is 0
(1 < 10) // repeat is 1
(2 < 10) // repeat is 2
(3 < 10) // repeat is 3
(4 < 10) // repeat is 4
(5 < 10) // repeat is 5
(6 < 10) // repeat is 6
(7 < 10) // repeat is 7
(8 < 10) // repeat is 8
(9 < 10) // repeat is 9
(10 < 10) // repeat is 10
When the value of repeat reaches 10, our while condition is no longer true and so JavaScript stops executing the contents of the block following the while statement and moves on.

Like blocks following if statements, any code can go inside the block following a while. For example, if we're worried our song outro is too repetitive we might decide to change the key after five repetitions.

const chorus = "Let's dance!";
let repeat = 0;
while (repeat < 10) {
  if (repeat === 5) {
    console.log("*change key*");
  }
  console.log(chorus);
  repeat++;
}
console.log("Until the sun comes up!");
Here, before printing the chorus for the sixth time (sixth because we've started counting at 0, not 1), we also instruct our pop star to change key before continuing. This works because the value of repeat will be equal to 5 only once—on the sixth iteration of our loop.

Instruction
Before continuing, commit your code.

git add chorus-while.js
git commit -m "Use a while loop to repeat a chorus line" 
For Loops
Instruction
Create a new file to tinker with the for loop the examples.

Create a new file in your lighthouse-js-fundamentals directory on Vagrant called chorus-for.js.

Another common structure for looping in JavaScript is the for loop. The idea of a for loop is very similar to a while, only all the code that relates to the state of the loop is written on one line.

const chorus = "Let's dance!";
for (let repeat = 0; repeat < 10; repeat++) {
  console.log(chorus);
}
console.log("Until the sun comes up!");
